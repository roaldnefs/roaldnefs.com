      <description>Sometimes a pull request on GitHub.com needs some work before it can be merged into the project but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to force the required work on the pull requests original author. You&amp;rsquo;re allowed to make changes to the pull request if they are opened to a repository you have push access to, the fork is user-owned, the user has granted the required permissions and there aren&amp;rsquo;t any branch restrictions that will prevent committing.</description>
