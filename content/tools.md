I often get questions about the specific software or hardware I use. Since my setup changes frequently, this page serves as a living document where I keep everything up to date. It’s a handy resource to share when people ask. If you notice something missing or have a suggestion, feel free to reach out, and I’ll make sure to add it.

## Hardware Hacking

Hardware hacking is all about exploring, testing, and interacting with physical devices in creative and unconventional ways. Whether it's working with wireless communication protocols or interfacing with USB devices, having the right tools is essential. Below, I've listed some of the hardware I rely on for RF and USB hacking, along with a brief overview of how I use them in my projects.

### Automotive

#### Hardware
- [CANable Pro](https://canable.io/): A small low-cost open source USB to CAN adapter.
- [CL2000](https://www.csselectronics.com/products/can-bus-logger-interface-cl2000): A CAN bus logger and USB interface with a real-time clock.

### Software
- [SavvyCAN](https://www.savvycan.com/): A cross platform CAN bus reverse engineering and capture tool.

### RF

#### Hardware
- [YARD Stick One](https://greatscottgadgets.com/yardstickone/): A versatile sub-1 GHz wireless testing tool controlled via your computer. I own multiple units and pair them with the [ANT500](https://greatscottgadgets.com/ant500/), a telescopic antenna designed to operate across 75 MHz to 1 GHz. See the related post about [updating the YARD Stick One firmware]({{< ref "/posts/2019-01-17-ys1-upgrade-firmware.md" >}}).
- [HackRF One](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/): A Software Defined Radio peripheral capable of transmission or reception of radio signals from 1 MHz to 6 GHz.

### RFID/NFC

#### Hardware
- [Proxmark 3 Easy](https://proxmark.com/proxmark-3-hardware/proxmark-3-easy): An RFID swiss-army tool, allowing for both high and low level interactions with the vast majority of RFID tags and systems. I own a [clone](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005005328485273.html) of the official Proxmark. See the related post about [spoofing microschips]({{< ref "/posts/2022-11-30-spoofing-microchips.md" >}}).
- [ACR122U](http://www.acs.com.hk/en/products/3/acr122u-usb-nfc-reader/): An USB NFC Reader.
- [Halo scanner](https://haloscanner.nl/en/): A handheld scanner used to scan the microchip numbers of animals. See the related post about [spoofing microschips]({{< ref "/posts/2022-11-30-spoofing-microchips.md" >}}).

### USB

#### Hardware
- [GreatFET One](https://greatscottgadgets.com/greatfet/one/): A powerful USB interface for hardware hacking and development.

### Soldering

#### Hardware
- [KSGER T12](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1486111): A soldering station with configurable temperature and interchangeable tips.


### Lockpicking

#### Hardware
- [SouthOrd PXS-14](https://www.southord.com/collections/lock-pick-sets-standard/products/lock-pick-set-14-piece-pxs-14): A 14-piece lock pick set.
