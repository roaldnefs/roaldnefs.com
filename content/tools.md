I often get questions about the specific software or hardware I use. Since my setup changes frequently, this page serves as a living document where I keep everything up to date. It’s a handy resource to share when people ask. If you notice something missing or have a suggestion, feel free to reach out, and I’ll make sure to add it.

## Hardware Hacking

Hardware hacking is all about exploring, testing, and interacting with physical devices in creative and unconventional ways. Whether it's working with wireless communication protocols or interfacing with USB devices, having the right tools is essential. Below, I've listed some of the hardware I rely on for RF and USB hacking, along with a brief overview of how I use them in my projects.

### RF

#### Hardware
- [YARD Stick One](https://greatscottgadgets.com/yardstickone/): A versatile sub-1 GHz wireless testing tool controlled via your computer. I own multiple units and pair them with the [ANT500](https://greatscottgadgets.com/ant500/), a telescopic antenna designed to operate across 75 MHz to 1 GHz.

### USB

#### Hardware
- [GreatFET One](https://greatscottgadgets.com/greatfet/one/): A powerful USB interface for hardware hacking and development.
