      <description>Sometimes a pull request on GitHub.com needs some work before it can be merged into the project but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to force the required work on the pull requests original author. You&amp;rsquo;re allowed to make changes to the pull request if they are opened to a repository you have push access to, the fork is user-owned, the user has granted the required permissions and there aren&amp;rsquo;t any branch restrictions that will prevent committing.</description>

      <description>A microchip implanted under the skin of an animal can be used for identification purposes. The microchips are using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to transmit an unique tag number using an electromagnetic field when in close contact with an nearby RFID reader device. The microchips are often used to help return lost pets quickly. The unique chip numbers are registered in a designated portal to let animal shelters, animal control officers and veterinarians to look up contact information of the animal&amp;rsquo;s owner.</description>

      <title>Ding Dong Ditch using SDR and Arduino</title>

      <description>In this post we will be building a device to play Ding Dong Ditch digitally. The device will ring the doorbell every several seconds without pressing the button. This project is all about reverse engineering radio frequencies using a RLT-SDR and creating hardware using an Arduino.
This project is heavily based upon the Digital Ding Dong Ditch by Samy Kamkar.
The video is a short demonstration of the Ding Dong Ditch device.</description>

      <title>Hardware Reversing the Sitecom Wireless Router 150N X1</title>

      <description>Last week I&amp;rsquo;ve bought a Rigol DS1102E digital oscilloscope and was very eager to test it out. When going to my bin of old hardware I&amp;rsquo;ve found a Sitecom Wireless Router 150N X1. After opening up the router I immediately spotted the UART debugging interface (top left in the picture). In this post we will go through the process of connecting to an unknown serial interface.
The UART debugging interface wasn&amp;rsquo;t labeled, so I had to figure out what each port was doing.</description>

      <title>Update YARD Stick One Firmware</title>
      <link>https://roaldnefs.com/posts/2019/01/update-yard-stick-one-firmware/</link>

      <description>Today I received my YARD Stick One (Yet Another Radio Dongle) created by Great Scott Gadgets. The dongle can transmit and receive digital wireless signals at frequencies below 1GHz. The YARD Stick One is not a SDR, because the I/Q samples are directly demodulated by the chipset instead of send to the host over USB. The YARD Stick One therefore isnâ€™t compatible with any SDR software, but you can use something called rfcat.</description>

      <title>Software Defined Radio on Linux</title>

      <description>In the quick start guide for Software Defined Radio (SDR) on Linux we will listen to some very common frequencies using a RTL-SDR. SDR is a radio communication system where traditional hardware components are instead implemented in software. Some common low-cost DVB-T USB dongles with the Realtek RTL2832U controller and tuner can be used as a wide-band SDR receiver.
Prerequisites Start by installing the required packages for downloading and compiling the rtl-sdr package.</description>
