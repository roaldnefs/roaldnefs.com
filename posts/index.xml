      <description>Last week I&amp;rsquo;ve bought a Rigol DS1102E digital oscilloscope and was very eager to test it out. When going to my bin of old hardware I&amp;rsquo;ve found a Sitecom Wireless Router 150N X1. After opening up the router I immediately spotted the UART debugging interface (top left in the picture). In this post we will go through the process of connecting to an unknown serial interface.
The UART debugging interface wasn&amp;rsquo;t labeled, so I had to figure out what each port was doing.</description>

      <description>Today I received my YARD Stick One (Yet Another Radio Dongle) created by Great Scott Gadgets. The dongle can transmit and receive digital wireless signals at frequencies below 1GHz. The YARD Stick One is not a SDR, because the I/Q samples are directly demodulated by the chipset instead of send to the host over USB. The YARD Stick One therefore isnâ€™t compatible with any SDR software, but you can use something called rfcat.</description>
